Description: SLAPenrich implements a statistical framework to identify pathways that tend to be recurrently genomically altered across a the samples of a genomic dataset. Differently from traditional over-recurrence analyses, SLAPenrich does not require the genes belonging to a given pathway to be statistically enriched among those altered in the individual samples. Additionally it assumes that a pathway might be disregulated in a given sample even if only one of its composing genes is genomically altered in that sample.
